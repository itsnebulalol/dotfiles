# Nebula's Dotfiles

Here are my dotfiles! I tend to reinstall macOS alot, so I decided to put all my scripts into a repository for easy download.

Keep in mind, the dotfiles are meant for **my use**. You'll have to edit the .gitconfig and the software script to download what you'd like.

## Install

Again, you should modify the stuff here! Fork it, modify stuff, and run your modified install.sh file!
